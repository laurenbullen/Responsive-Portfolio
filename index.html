      <img src="assets/images/pic.jpeg" class="auth-image" alt="Lauren Bullen">

      <p>I am a Bay Area native looking to flip my current career as an editor for health website into a career as a        full-time web developer. While not doing coding away and doing my best to keep up with this program, I love        eating,drinking, binge-watching Netflix, and relaxing with family and friends. I am also semi-obsessed with my     family dog Bode, who is the most precious Bernese Mountain Dog I've ever laid eyes on&#33;
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>Majoring in molecular biology at UCSC (go Banana Slugs&#33;) has prepared me to work hard and dive into solving    difficult problems head on. I am going from learning about the building blocks of life to learning about the       building blocks of the internet, and I could not be more excited&#33;
